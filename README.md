# 160 Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **160 Days DSA Challenge** by GeeksforGeeks! ðŸŽ¯

## About the Challenge
I have taken up the 160 Days Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge offered by GeeksforGeeks. This challenge is designed to enhance my problem-solving skills and strengthen my understanding of core DSA concepts. Each day, I will tackle new problems and concepts, applying what I learn to improve my coding abilities.

## Structure of the Repository
This repository will serve as a log of my progress, with solutions and explanations to the problems I solve throughout the challenge.

### Folder Structure:
- **Day_1/** - Solutions for Day 1 problems
- **Day_2/** - Solutions for Day 2 problems
- ...
- **Day_160/** - Solutions for Day 160 problems

Each folder contains:
1. **Problem Statements**: A brief description of the problems solved.
2. **Code Files**: Solution files written in Python/C++/Java (or a combination).
3. **Explanations**: Additional notes or comments explaining the approach used.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/160-days-dsa-challenge.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder of the day you want to explore.
3. Open the code files to view the solutions.

## Goals
- Master core data structures and algorithms.
- Improve coding speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for competitive programming and technical interviews.
